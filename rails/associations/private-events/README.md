# Private-events app
(a'la Eventbrite)

[Associations project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) from **The Odin Project** course.

Build a site similar to a Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's House"). A user can create events and can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
